## 8Ball

This is a simple remake of the 8Ball app in Swift which is a fun and interactive fortune-telling application that provides random responses to users' questions using a magic 8-ball and resets itself every 4 seconds if the user goes inactive. I learned how to use the shake animation, using assets, and overall gained experience with the language and Xcode.
